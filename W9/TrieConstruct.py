Solve the Trie Construction Problem.
     Input: A collection of strings Patterns.
     Output: The adjacency list corresponding to Trie(Patterns), in the following format. If Trie(Patterns) has
     n nodes, first label the root with 1 and then label the remaining nodes with the integers 2 through n in
     any order you like. Each edge of the adjacency list of Trie(Patterns) will be encoded by a triple: the first
     two members of the triple must be the integers labeling the initial and terminal nodes of the edge,
     respectively; the third member of the triple must be the symbol labeling the edge.
